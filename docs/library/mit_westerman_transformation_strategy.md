# MIT — Westerman: Strategy for Digital Transformation (Aurora Summary)

This note integrates the key insights from Dr. George Westerman's work on digital transformation and adapts them to Aurora's operating doctrine.

## Executive summary

The central insight is simple but profound: technology alone does not create value — the value comes from how organizations apply technology to transform core processes, experiences and business models. For Aurora, this reinforces our intelligence-first approach: our systems must prioritize measurable transformation outcomes over raw technical novelty.

## Core principles extracted

1. Technology is an enabler, not the goal

   - We must evaluate features and MVPs by their transformational impact (KPIs), not only by technical metrics.

2. Four domains of transformation

   - Customer Experience (CX): Improvements that change how customers perceive and interact with services.
   - Operations: Internal process automation and optimization that reduce cost and increase speed/quality.
   - Business Models: New revenue streams or shifts in unit economics enabled by technology.
   - Employee Experience (EX): Tools and processes that make employees more effective and fulfilled.

3. Validate hybrid architectures

   - Westerman advocates pragmatic, hybrid approaches. For Aurora, the hybrid stack (generative AI + classical AI + TI + human-in-the-loop) is validated: it balances cost, latency, reliability, and governance.

4. Governance + experimentation
   - Encourage rapid experiments with guardrails. Scale only the patterns that show measurable impact. Governance must balance control and autonomy.

## Practical implications for Aurora

- Product criteria: every feature must map to at least one of the four transformation axes and include a success metric (OKR/KPI).
- Architecture: design connectors, agents and pipelines to make measurement and A/B testing straightforward.
- Culture: foster a culture where teams propose experiments, measure impact, and evolve components based on evidence.

## Suggested artifacts to add to the Codex and Playbooks

- `experiment_template.md` — minimal template for proposals (hypothesis, metric, data collection plan, rollback plan).
- `transformation_kpi_catalog.md` — catalog of suggested KPIs per domain (CX, Ops, Biz Model, EX).
